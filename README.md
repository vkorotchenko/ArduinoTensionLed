# ArduinoTensionLed

### Goal
The goal of this project is to establish communications with the tension climbing app and display the correct leds in the correct color when available

### Hardware
This project is running on Arduino Nano 33 IoT. Other devices should be compatible with the used libraries. If using other boards please update platformio.ini to configure board and libraries. The limiting factor would be the boards that are supported by the ardiono BLE library. 

### Status
This is currently in beta testing. Currently have all the holds and footbolds lighting up properly. ongoing testing for multiple user support.
